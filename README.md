- Big new release with a lot of changes and improvements!

- The biggest change is the move of a bunch of core features to
  [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) and fully
  integrating it into **LazyVim**.

- I highly suggest having a look at the **snacks.nvim** documentation
  to see all the new features and improvements. Most important changes:
  - `Snacks.notifier` for notifications instead of `nvim-notify`
  - `Snacks.terminal` is similar to `lazyterm`, but has more features
    and creates bottom splits by default (similar to the `edgy` integrating)
